To run the code press the run button or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>

### Setting Up Locally

* With NodeJS

```
npm i -g bower # install bower
bower install # install the components
npm install # install express and others
npm start # start the express server
```
This should launch a local server ready for using. 

* Without NodeJS

If you would like to deploy it somewhere where NodeJS is not an option (eg. Github pages), you can deploy it without NodeJS. However, you need to install the dependencies using bower and include the `bower_components` directory with it. 

```
npm i -g bower
bower install
```
